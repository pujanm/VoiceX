### Problem Statement:

Making notes during a meeting is a skillfull task as it would require the person
to remember the key points while being engaged in the discussion. This task would
usually be achieved by a human assistant who would take notes during the
discussion or meeting. We need to replace the human assistant with a digital assistant,
who would be part of the meeting and take notes on key points. So, the
assistant should have some essential functions -

● Transcript of the meeting acquired [ various methods - speech to text,
OCR, manual script ]

● Process the text generated, and make notes out of it

● Tag and store those notes for future processes
